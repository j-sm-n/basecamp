        <h1>This is what you should know about me</h1>

        <p>I don’t know how many wanna-be tech journalists later become software developers, but I’m happy to be in that group regardless. My decision to pursue software development full-time came after working as a project manager at a mobile app agency and wanting to more fully understand how to build products that clients and users actually want to use on the development side.</p>

        <p>About 75% of my day-to-day as a project manager involved talking to clients either in person, over the phone or via email. I got really good at putting out fires all while maintaining a positive and helpful attitude. I also got really good at asking for help or clarification from my design or development team when I didn’t know the answers. Project management made sense for me at the time, but learning how to be on the technical end of the product cycle started to catch my eye, so I decided to jump head first.</p>

        <p>While I took some online courses on Rails and JavaScript thanks to companies like Skillcrush, Codecademy and Free Code Camp, I didn’t feel like I really understood what I was doing until I attended the Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, Colo. I recently graduated from the backend program in January 2017 and feel like that the last 7+ months positioned me to be a good asset to a team that cares as much about their users as Basecamp does.</p>

        <p>While in journalism school, I learned how to concisely convey complicated ideas to different audiences in engaging ways. I’ve come to find that this is a skill that translates well to explaining code to others, too. Investigative journalism also always excited me because it gave me an outlet to ask questions and to find answers; Unsurprisingly, I’ve found this same sense of excitement in programming when figuring out bugs or planning out how to implement new features in existing code.</p>

        <p>When it comes down to it, I’m all about problem solving. Basecamp has a culture of teaching and learning that I know I would thrive in, and feel confident that I could contribute to.</p>

        <p><b>BONUS:</b> My future coworkers should know that I love lists. Handwritten, Wunderlist, sticky notes, etc. As an example, here’s a list of my favorite blogs:</p>
